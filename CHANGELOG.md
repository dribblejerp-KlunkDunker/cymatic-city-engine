# Changelog

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-16

- Time axis: `simulate()` founds the city at the strongest antinode near the drive point, grows it outward on a 3.7 %/yr built-up curve, ages buildings on Weibull lifetimes with densifying rebuilds under the structural limits, and produces keyframes that are complete cities with rebuilt networks, stats and checks.
- Flow model: hourly profiles; Hazen-Williams pressure along water mains; three-phase voltage drop along feeders with 11 kV cable classes; Manning partial-flow sewer fullness; gravity-model metro assignment with AM/PM direction.
- Failure analysis: `impact()` for every asset kind; `resilience()` N-1 per network.
- Power grid: a second injection point (grid intertie), substation-to-substation backup lines routed away from busy trenches, N-1 scored per corridor.
- Viewer: timeline with keyframes and a plan button, hour-of-day flow colouring and tiles, Fail buttons, resilience tiles, worker-side simulation with progress.
- Tests: 74; third independent review with fixes.
- Roadmap: ROADMAP.md.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-15

- Physics core: disk membrane, square Chladni plate (corner coordinates), scalar sphere; normalised driven modal response with drive-point coupling and pattern sharpness.
- City layer: nodal boulevards, contour rings, gradient streets, perimeter wall; lot grid with exact road clearance; zoning, districts and landmarks; material, slenderness, lift-core and terrace limits; measured plausibility checks.
- Underground: street graph with junctions, service laterals, gravity sewers with lift stations and force mains, looped water mains with tanks and a treatment plant, power plant / substations / feeders / transmission, metro tunnels below every foundation, utility galleries for arcologies.
- Viewer: Surface / X-ray / Underground, layers, section cut, fly controls, click-to-inspect with Focus, themes, custom settlements, custom materials, realism toggle, profiles, OBJ/JSON/PNG export.
- Tests: 56; two independent review passes with fixes.
